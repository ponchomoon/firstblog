        <h1>Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?</h1>
        <h2>First Mile Blog Post</h2>

        <span>
            <p> Deciding what you are going to do with your life after arriving as a migrant in one of the most competitive countries in the world is a great challenge. I am Colombian who came to Australia four years ago and after analysing options I have decided
            to study Software Engineering. Within the reasons are:</p>

            <ol class="listaordenada">
                <li>You can work independently: Having the skills to be part of a team is vital to being a programmer. Today, almost all developments (both web and applications or video games) are implemented by development groups, which almost always tend to be made up of an analyst
                    and several programmers. But when it comes to starting a private business or earning a little extra money, things change. You can have your job full time and spend your free time creating new projects that will bring you significant
                    benefits. For that you do not need to be part of a team, you will be yourself against the world. As a web developer, you can create web applications, websites, themes, and many more digital products that can be easily monetized.</li> <br>
                <li>It has a future: As we move into an increasingly digital future, developer skills are increasingly in demand. In this sense, it is advisable to train in those programming languages ​​that are most promising.</li> <br>
            <li>Traveling and working remotely: Positions related to web design and development are some of those that allow access to teleworking more easily. This means that you can perform your function from anywhere. Even traveling to other countries. You only need an equipped computer and a good Internet connection to work.</li> <br>
                    <li>Preference for dynamic work and avoid monotony and repetitive work: No two web pages are the same, and each requires a different suite of features and tools. They all generally have the same base, but the development that starts from it is unique in each case. In addition, the lack of monotony makes it necessary to master various techniques. This will allow you to have a remarkable experience in creating websites in a relatively short time.</li>
